### Open Private Join & Activation (OPJA)

**Goal**:

The goal is to support a protocol for sending [OPJA](https://iabtechlab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Open-Private-Join-Activation_Version_1.011.pdf) encrypted matching labels using OpenRTB 2.x.

**Requested Changes**:

Addition to **User Extension** Object

### Details

Open Private Join & Activation (OPJA) is a protocol for enabling two parties to privately generate activation matches.
OPJA uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep private data securely encrypted throughout all steps of the bid process.
Note, it is assumed that parties will collaborate with the appropriate regulatory agencies and vendor(s) to ensure compliance.

A new field under `BidRequest->user->ext` is specified which is named `ojpa`. 
It is an array of objects describing match jobs, each could be generated by one or more matching vendors.

Below we describe each field within each match job object:

| Key                 | Type             | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| name                | String           | A hostname uniquely identifying the matching system used |
| matches             | Array of Objects | An array of objects containing encrypted matching labels |
| matches[].id        | String           | The alphanumeric match transaction ID which is unique to each match job row (maximum 16 characters) |
| matches[].el        | String           | The base64 encoded encrypted label which can be used to determine a match (maximum 36 characters with padding) |
