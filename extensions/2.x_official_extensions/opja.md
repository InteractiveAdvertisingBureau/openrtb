### Open Private Join & Activation (OPJA)

**Goal**:

The goal is to support a protocol for sending [OPJA](https://iabtechlab.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Open-Private-Join-Activation_Version_1.011.pdf) encrypted matching labels using OpenRTB 2.x.

**Requested Changes**:

Addition to **User Extension** Object

### Details

Open Private Join & Activation (OPJA) is a protocol for enabling two parties to privately generate activation matches.
OPJA uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep private data securely encrypted throughout all steps of the process.
Note, it is assumed that parties will collaborate with the appropriate regulatory agencies and vendor(s) to ensure compliance.

A new field under `BidRequest->user->ext` is specified which is named `ojpa`. 
It is an array of objects describing match jobs, each could be generated by one or more matching vendors.

Below we describe each field within each match job object:

| Key                 | Type             | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| name                | String           | The human readable name of the matching job |
| matches             | Array of Objects | An array of objects containing encrypted matching labels |
| matches[].id        | String           | The match transaction ID which is unique to each match job row |
| matches[].el        | String           | The encrypted label which can be used to determine a match |
