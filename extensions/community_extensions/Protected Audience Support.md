# Bid Request Values

## Object: InterestGroupAuctionSupport 

`BidRequest.imp.ext.igs`: This extension to "Object: Imp" allows sellers to signal Interest Group auction support for an Impression to buyers.

        3 = server-orchestrated Interest Group auction<br>
        <br>
        Note that this only indicates that the Interest Group auction is supported, not that it is guaranteed to execute. If no buyer chooses to participate in the Interest Group auction, then the Interest Group auction will be skipped and the winner of the OpenRTB (aka contextual) auction, if any, will serve instead.</td>

    Example: the publisher intends to enable Interest Group, but the seller has not onboarded this buyer for Interest Group auctions. Buyers should only expect sellers to honor corresponding Interest Group Intent signals when this field is 1.

## Bid Response

### Bid Placed with Interest Group Auction Intent by the Buyer
	
Following extends the Ad Served On Win Notice example to demonstrate a bidder placing a bid into the standard OpenRTB auction and also signaling intent to the seller for one IG owner/buyer to participate in potential on-device auction.


```json
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "bidid": "abc1123",
  "cur": "USD",
  "seatbid": [
    {
      "seat": "512",
      "bid": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "impid": "102",
          "price": 9.43,
          "nurl": "http://adserver.com/winnotice?impid=102",
          "iurl": "http://adserver.com/pathtosampleimage",
          "adomain": [
            "advertiserdomain.com"
          ],
          "cid": "campaign111",
          "crid": "creative112",
          "attr": [
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4,
            5,
            6,
            7,
            12
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
 "ext": {
    "igi":[{
      "impid": "1",
      "igb":[{   	 
        "origin": "https://paapi.dsp.com",
        "pbs": "{\"key\": \"value\"}"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### No Bid with Interest Group Auction Intent by the Buyer

Following is an example where a bidder places no bid in the standard OpenRTB auction, but does signal intent to participate in potential on-device IG auction.

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890", 
  "seatbid": [],
  "ext": {
    "igi":[{
        "impid": "1",
        "igb":[{   	 
          "origin": "https://paapi.dsp.com",
          "pbs": "{\"key\": \"value\"}"
        }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Auction Config Placed with Interest Group Auction Intent by the Seller
	
Following extends the Ad Served On Win Notice example to demonstrate a seller placing an auction config into the standard OpenRTB auction and also signaling intent to the publisher to participate in potential on-device auction.


```json
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "bidid": "abc1123",
  "cur": "USD",
  "seatbid": [
    {
      "seat": "512",
      "bid": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "impid": "102",
          "price": 9.43,
          "nurl": "http://adserver.com/winnotice?impid=102",
          "iurl": "http://adserver.com/pathtosampleimage",
          "adomain": [
            "advertiserdomain.com"
          ],
          "cid": "campaign111",
          "crid": "creative112",
          "attr": [
            1,
            2,
            3,
            4,
            5,
            6,
            7,
            12
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "ext": {
    "igi":[{
      "igs":[{
        "impid": "1",
        "config": {
          "key": "value"
        }
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Namespacing
#### Namespacing in auctionSignals
The auctionSignals metadata may originate from diverse sources, so this map should be â€˜namespacedâ€™ by the providing entity. Where an entity is using OpenRTB objects, it should provide them in an attribute named ortb2. For example:

```json
{
   ...
   "auctionSignals": {
      "prebid": {
         "ortb2": {
            "sparse OpenRTB Request"
         }
      },
      "seller": {
         "ortb2": {
            ...
         }
      }
    "other entities providing metadata, as needed"
   }
   ...
}
```

#### Namespacing in perBuyerSignals
Early PAAPI auction provisioning practice was for buyers to supply their <code>perBuyerSignals</code> to seller partners as a passthrough value in <code>BidResponse.ext.igbid[].igbuyer[].buyerdata</code> or some other means. The seller places this in the buyerâ€™s key in <code>auctionConfig.perBuyerSignals</code> and Protected Audience then provides the value as the <code>perBuyerSignals</code> parameter to <code>generateBid</code>. This does not afford a clean way for the seller to provide signals to a specific buyer, such as Deals.

To accommodate this, the community extensions support a more open <code>perBuyerSignals</code> handling. In an OpenRTB BidRequest sellers can signal their ability to provide and in the BidResponse buyers may opt in to receive an <code>InterestGroupAuctionBuyerSignals</code> object in the interest group auction. 

If buyer "https://dsp.example"â€™s igb.pbsmap is missing or 0, then the seller/SSP provides perBuyerSignals as:

```
"perBuyerSignals": {
"https://dsp.example": ... // BidResponse.ext.igi[].igb[].pbs
}
```

If the buyer opts into perBuyerSignals namespacing by returning pbsmap = 1, then the seller/SSP provides perBuyerSignalls as:

```
"perBuyerSignals": {
"https://dsp.example": {
        "buyer": â€¦  // BidResponse.ext.igi[].igb[].pbs,
        "seller": {
           "ortb2":{
                /* sparse ORTB value */
           }
        }
     }
}

{
   "buyer": ...,   /* buyerâ€™s pbs value as provided to the seller/publisher in BidResponse.ext.igi[].igb[].pbs */ 
   "seller": {
      "ortb2": {
         ...       /* buyer-specific BidRequest object values */ 
      } 
   }
}
```
