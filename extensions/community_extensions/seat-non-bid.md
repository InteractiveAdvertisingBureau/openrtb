# Seat Non Bid Response

Sponsors: Xandr, Magnite, CafeMedia, Media&#46;net

## Overview

Thereâ€™s an ongoing effort in the industry for exchanges to provide publishers with insights into why seats do not bid. Insights include reasons why the exchange did not request a bid from a seat, why a seat did not bid, and why a bid was considered invalid. Publishers want to use this information to learn how to improve performance and increase efficiency.

This proposal introduces an extension on the `BidResponse` object to enable each seat to provide a reason for not bidding, or for the exchange to provide a reason for not requesting a bid or rejecting a bid from a particular seat.

## Why Something New

The OpenRTB 2.x `BidResponse` object defines the `nbr` field to provide one reason for not bidding. There's no structure defined to convey granular information when some seats bid and others do not.

The `Bid` object cannot be extended for non bid scenarios since it constitutes an offer to buy an impression and requires a price. Similarly, the `SeatBid` object cannot be extended as it requires at least one `Bid`.

## Considerations

Exchanges and publishers who do not wish to emit or act upon these insights may choose to ignore this extension. Exchanges may provide an option to publishers for  including this level of detail.

There are many reasons for a non bid scenario and it is understood not all can be included in a standardized enumeration. Exchanges may use 500+ values to define their own reason codes as appropriate.

*Advertiser Exclusions vs Advertiser Blocked*:  "Exclusion" refers to scenarios of competitive separation, while "Blocked" refers to publisher driven block lists.

## Non Bid Status Codes Guidance

- Exchanges are encouraged to provide as much detail as possible, but it is acceptable to use the general codes (0, 100, 200, 300) when details aren't known.

- The values 1-17 intentionally overlap with the OpenRTB 3.0 [No-Bid Reason Codes](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/blob/master/OpenRTB%20v3.0%20FINAL.md#list--no-bid-reason-codes-) such that seats which provide a `nbr` can  easily mapping to a `statuscode`. 


Non Bid Status Code values are purposefully organized into the following ranges to assist with high level classification:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Interpretation</th>
      <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0-99</td>
      <td>No Bid</td>
      <td>Auction ran successfully without demand for the impression.</td>
      <td>Seats with low demand may be re-evaluated or optimized.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>100-199</td>
      <td>Error</td>
      <td>Technical problem occurred during the auction.</td>
      <td>Seat may need investigation to determine root cause.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>200-299</td>
      <td>Request Rejected</td>
      <td>Impression was explicitly not sent to the seat.</td>
      <td>Bid Request should be re-evaluated for unsupported impressions. May be expected due to exchange configuration.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>300-399</td>
      <td>Response Rejected</td>
      <td>Seat responded with a bid that was rejected by the exchange.</td>
      <td>Seat may need to resolve.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
